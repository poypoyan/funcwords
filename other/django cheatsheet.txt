New Project:
django-admin startproject fwphl

New App:
python manage.py startapp fwapp

Run Server:
python manage.py runserver

Migrate Models:
python manage.py makemigrations
python manage.py migrate

Create Superuser (Admin):
python manage.py createsuperuser

Change Admin Password:
python manage.py changepassword <user_name>

Testing:
python manage.py test

Init steps:
1) In Django, migrate models
2) In MySQL server, run fwphl_triggers.sql
3) In Django, create superuser
4) (Optional) Run tagalog_personal_pronouns_insert.sql for initial data

Re-init steps before doing init steps above:
1) In MySQL server, drop database.
2) In Django, delete all .py files under fwApp/migrations except __init__.py.

To view HTTP error response pages (do this locally only!):
1) In settings.py, set DEBUG = False and ALLOWED_HOSTS = ['*']. Remember the previous settings.
2) Run server with "--insecure" flag to force Django to serve static files even on DEBUG = False.
3) Test by typing a URL outside patterns coded in urls.py and urls_app.py.
4) After testing, in settings.py, set DEBUG = True and apply previous settings.

To view actual SQL query in views.py:
1) print(sample_query.query)

Generate Models from Existing Database:
python manage.py inspectdb > myApp/models.py
GOTCHA: models.py should be saved to UTF-8!
