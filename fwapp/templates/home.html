<h1>Welcome!</h1>
<br/>
<p>This is an expanding compilation of <i>Function Words in Philippine Languages</i> (FWPHL).
Function words are words that provide grammatical structure to a sentence, rather than being representations of objects or phenomena.
These are pronouns, case markers, affixes, conjunctions, particles, etc. This project aims to collect these words from over a hundred languages in the Philippines, to better see the similarities and differences among the languages.</p>
<br/>
<p>This is a simple side project for learning <a href="https://www.djangoproject.com/">Django</a> and Web development in general.
I don't want to put ads here; in case you want to support me on this goofy endeavor, I'll put my <a href="https://ko-fi.com/">Ko-fi</a> page later on if I continued working on this. Thanks for visiting!</p>

<h3>Conventions</h3>
<br/>
<ul class="long-li">
  <li>In most Philippine languages, stress on syllable can change the meaning of the word. The heading text in a term page will have diacritics if we have data on the pronunciation, following <i>Filpino Orthography</i>. These are usually not written, but will serve as pronunciation guide.
  The acute marker (´) on a vowel indicates stress, meaning it is uttered longer. The grave marker (`) on a vowel indicates a glottal stop after. The circumflex marker (ˆ) is the combination of the previous two.
  For example, "uh oh" can be written in the described style as "ô ow". The dash in the middle of word indicates either a glottal stop between a consonant and then a vowel, or two (or more) words compounded into one. Lastly the character ë will represent schwa, which is found in some Philippine languages.</li>
  <li>If the heading text for a term uses a consonant not in the English alphabet (e.g., ñ), the orthography followed will be in References.</li>
  <li>The terms <a href="/category/nominative">Nominative</a>, <a href="/category/genitive">Genitive</a>, and <a href="/category/oblique">Oblique</a> are used for the three "cases" commonly found in Philippine languages. See the respective pages for details.</li>
