<h1>Welcome!</h1>
<br/>
<p>This is an expanding compilation of <i>Function Words in Philippine Languages</i> (FWPHL).
Function words are words that provide grammatical structure to a sentence, rather than being representations of objects or phenomena.
These are pronouns, case markers, affixes, conjunctions, particles, etc. This project aims to collect these words from over a hundred languages in the Philippines, to better see the similarities and differences among those.</p>
<br/>
<p>This is a simple side project for learning <a href="https://www.djangoproject.com/">Django</a> and Web development in general.
I don't want to put ads here; in case you want to support me on this goofy endeavor, I'll put my <a href="https://ko-fi.com/">Ko-fi</a> page later if I continued working on this. Thanks for visiting!</p>
