<p>This is an expanding compilation of <i>Function Words in Philippine Languages</i> (FWPHL).
Function words are words that provide grammatical structure to a sentence, rather than being representations of objects or phenomena.
These are pronouns, case markers, affixes, conjunctions, particles, etc.</p>
